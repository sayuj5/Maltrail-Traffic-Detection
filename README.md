# Maltrail-Traffic-Detection
This project utilizes Maltrail to set up a traffic detection system, demonstrating network security monitoring techniques and the analysis of network traffic for potential malware and suspicious activity.
# Traffic Detection System using Maltrail

## Overview

This project shows how you can set up a traffic detection system using Maltrail.  Essentially, we're using Maltrail to keep an eye on network activity, analyze it, and spot any potential security threats.  This was a minor project I worked on for my Semester IV Cyber Forensic & Information Security course.

## Installation and Setup

Here's how to get Maltrail up and running so you can detect traffic:

1.  **Get the Maltrail code:**
    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/stamparm/maltrail.git](https://github.com/stamparm/maltrail.git)
    cd maltrail
    ```
    This downloads the Maltrail software from its source and gets you into the right folder.

2.  **Install the necessary tools:**
    ```bash
    python setup.py install
    ```
    This command installs the required components for Maltrail to work.  You might need a few extra things depending on your system, so check out the official Maltrail documentation if you run into any snags.

3.  **Start the traffic sensor:**
    ```bash
    python sensor.py
    ```
    This launches the Maltrail sensor, which is the part that actually captures and examines network traffic.  You'll need the right permissions on your system to do this.

4.  **Start the Maltrail server:**
    ```bash
    python server.py
    ```
    This starts the web interface for Maltrail, which lets you see what's going on.  You can usually access it in your web browser at `http://localhost:8338`.

## Usage

Here's how to use Maltrail once it's set up:

1.  **Open the Maltrail Web Interface:** Just open your web browser and go to the address where the Maltrail server is running.

2.  **Watch the Network Traffic:** The Maltrail dashboard will show you what's happening on your network in real-time and point out any potential threats it finds.  It uses its threat intelligence database to do this.

3.  **Look at the Detected Events:** You can dig into the details of any detected events, like where the traffic came from and went to (IP addresses), which ports were used, what protocols were involved (like UDP DNS), and any flags that might indicate malware or suspicious activity.

4.  **Investigate Further (Optional):** As I did in the project, you can take any interesting IP addresses and check them out on external threat intelligence platforms like VirusTotal.  This helps you get a better understanding of how risky they are and what kind of malicious activity might be associated with them.

## Project Context

I developed this project as part of my coursework for the Cyber Forensic & Information Security department at Behala Govt Polytechnic in Semester IV.  The main goals were to:

* Get a hands-on understanding of Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS) and Intrusion Prevention Systems (IPS).
* Learn about Network Security Monitoring (NSM).
* Get practical experience with Maltrail for detecting and analyzing threats in real-time.

## Disclaimer

This project is really meant for learning purposes and shows a basic way to set up a traffic detection system with Maltrail.  If you want to use this in a real-world, production environment, you'll need to make sure it's configured properly, that you have good security measures in place, and that you keep Maltrail and its threat intelligence data updated.
